# Bayes Classifier

This is an implementation of a [naive Bayes classifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier) in python. I've applied it to the familiar [Wine Dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine) to try it out in practice and experiment with the parameters. The graph below presents a relationship between the size of a training set and the classifier's accuracy. As you can observe, a training set containing circa 25 records provides an accuracy at the level of 90%.
